Coding Exercise for Platform Engineer position


Hello, my name is Tim Molina and here is my project. I just made a simple site that fell within the parameters of the prompt.
I did however spend a little longer than three hours on it, mainly on styling and ironing out a few bugs that I encountered, but nothing too bad I suppose!
Another extra thing I did was that I made it accessible to mobile users with an emphasis on responsive design, however I do suspect certain tablets would
look quite a bit "off" to say the least.

As for what excites me about the opportunity to work at Stevens, I have to admit that everything about it is very attractive to me, from the culture, to the job that I would hypothetically be doing.
I want to work at Stevens as a Platform Engineer because it is a job that I know I can be successful at. I have the skills required as listed in the job description, which can be found
in my resume and portfolio. But to be specific, I know React, JavaScript, CSS/HTML, and a little MySQL, although PostgreSQL is what I have more experience in, however;
it is not hard for me to pick any technology up. This is not only my career, but also my hobby, as I also have knowledge in a few other skills that are not listed in the description,
specifically my favorite which is C# as I enjoy making video games in my off time with other specific technologies.

I am a creator and technophile at my core, and although I am still early on in my career, I desire for nothing more than to get better at what I do.
I believe that Stevens can provide for me the environment to refine my skills and grow in my career while also being able to contribute to something that I admire!
