Coding Exercise for Platform Engineer position


Hello, my name is Tim Molina and here is my project. I just made a simple site that fell within the parameters of the prompt.
I did however spend a little longer than three hours on it, mainly on styling and ironing out a few bugs that I encountered, but nothing too bad I suppose!
Another extra thing I did was that I made it accessible to mobile users with an emphasis on responsive design, however I do suspect certain tablets would
look quite a bit "off" to say the least. Something that I couldn't add due to time constraints was unit testing, although that is a weakness of mine, I do like to usually include it for a bit of practice.

As for what excites me about the opportunity to work at Stevens, I have to admit that everything about it is very attractive to me, from the culture, to the job that I would hypothetically be doing. I want to work at Stevens as a Platform Engineer because it is a job that I know I can be successful in. I have the skills required as listed in the job description, which can be found in my resume and portfolio, as well as the drive to improve. But to be specific, I know React, JavaScript, CSS/HTML, and a little MySQL, although PostgreSQL is what I have more experience in, however; it is not hard for me to pick any technology up. This is not only my career, but also my hobby, as I also have knowledge in a few other skills that are not listed in the description, specifically my favorite which is C# as I enjoy making video games in my off time with other associated technologies.

I am a creator and technophile at my core, and although I am still early on in my career, I desire for nothing more than to get better at what I do.
I believe that Stevens can provide for me the environment to refine my skills and grow in my career while also being able to contribute to something that I admire!

--- Build Instructions (if necessary) ---:
To run directly in code, I just used the VSCode extension called "Live Server." Normally, in my testing environments I like to do two checks, one with the extension, and the other using Express.js + a localhost server, however; this project was to be done using Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS according to the prompt so I did not go that route.
I will host this on a github pages page for ease of access, as well as sending my code itself.
